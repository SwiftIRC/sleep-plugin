# SleepPlugin Changelog

## Unreleased

### Improvements
- Added support for Minecraft 26.3 (Wilderness Bound)
- Straw beds count toward the sleep percentage like regular beds (Paper fires the standard bed enter/leave events for them)

### Technical Changes
- Compile against Paper API 26.3 (`api-version` stays 26.1, so the same jar runs on 26.1-26.3)

---

## Version 1.0.4 (2026-08-06)

### New Features
- Added support for Minecraft 26.x (Paper/Purpur/Spigot) and Java 25
- Added configurable `sleep-percentage` (per world) - default 50%, clamped to 1-100
- Added bossbar showing sleep progress (enabled/color/style/title configurable)
- Added phantom prevention via `spawn_phantoms` game rule (`prevent-phantoms`)
- Added per-world settings overrides (`world-settings` section)
- Added admin command `/sleep reload|status` with tab completion
- Added optional LuckyPerms integration (soft-dependency):
  - Weighted sleep votes via `sleepplugin.weight` meta
  - `sleepplugin.exempt` permission to exclude players from calculations
  - `sleepplugin.bypass.min-players` permission to skip nights alone or below the minimum

### Improvements
- Updated build system to Gradle 9.6.1 with plugin-yml generation
- Generated `plugin.yml` with command and permission registration
- `sleep-percentage` keeps at least 1 player always required
- Release workflow targets Minecraft 26.x / Java 25+

### Technical Changes
- Raised `api-version` to 26.1
- `GameRule.getByName` now tries `spawn_phantoms` then `doInsomnia` (legacy) for cross-implementation support
- Added LuckyPerms API as compileOnly dependency
- CI build artifacts now named after the plugin version (e.g. `SleepPlugin-1.0.4`)
